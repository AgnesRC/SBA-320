Live Site Link:


In this project, I used React to create a recipe site where you can search for recipes and fetch random recipes from the TheMealDB API. 

Technologies Used:


HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React: used to create structure, style and add interactivity to site.

AJAX: used to fetch data from the external API for display on the DOM. 

Netlify: used to deploy the application.

Approach Taken:


React components (Favorites, RandomRecipe, RecipeCard, etc.) and hooks (useState, useEffect, useLocalStorage) used for modularity and functionality. 

AJAX requests made using fetch to interact with the API.

Created structure and style using HTML & CSS.
